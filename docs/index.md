# Sam Pollard

I am a first year PhD student at the University of Bristol, supervised by Dr. Michael Wray. Before this, I completed my MEng in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Bristol. My research will principally focus on computer vision, though I remain interested in compressed sensing, group testing and general probability.
