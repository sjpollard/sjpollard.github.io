# Sam Pollard ({{ site.github_username }})

I am a second year PhD student at the University of Bristol, supervised by Dr. Michael Wray. My research will principally focus on computer vision, though I remain interested in compressed sensing, group testing and general probability. I am currently looking at data redundancy in vision models.

Before this, I completed my MEng in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Bristol and received a First. My dissertation, titled "Compressed Learning for Egocentric Action Recognition", was awarded the prize of Best Computer Vision Project.
